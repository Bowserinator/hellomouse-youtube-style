*Get this page style and others back! (Extension output example above)*

Around October 26th 2022 youtube released a new UI update, with lots of round buttons, bad features, etc...

This user CSS undoes most of that (and has some "enhancements" of my own, you can look for them in the CSS and disable them if you don't like them). There are also a few settings you can adjust.

### Bug Fixes / Common Problems

**Note: if you see 2 description boxes enable the bug fix in the settings, I have no idea what other extension or youtube feature causes this**

- If you see no description box + channel, disable the bug fix in the settings


### Installation:

#### 1. Get the [Stylus] browser extension
![Stylus for Chrome](https://img.shields.io/badge/Get_Stylus_for-Chrome-blue.svg)
![Stylus for Firefox](https://img.shields.io/badge/Get_Stylus_for-Firefox-orange.svg)
![Stylus for Opera](https://img.shields.io/badge/Get_Stylus_for-Opera-red.svg)

#### 2. Add scripts to Stylus
Go here https://userstyles.world/style/7450/undo-bad-youtube-ui-update and click the install button

Alternatively, you can go to the `youtube-style-combined.user.css` file and click "Raw" in the top-right corner, Stylus 
should offer to install it.

### Features (v1.0.0)

- Restore the old style for playlist titles, video thumbnail titles, channel names, etc...
- Move video buttons to top again, remove btn labels for more compact interface (optional) (that can fit all buttons including *Add to Playlist*)
- Remove the ugly new description box styles and move date added to top
- Red subscribe buttons
- Make new playlist page slightly more bearable
- (Adjustable) Border radius on most things, unrounded UI as was before

- (Optional) Red/green styling for "Return Youtube Dislikes" ratio bar
- (Optional) Always show titles in video end card grid

### (v1.1.0)
- Made playlist thumbnails smaller again (why did youtube think making them big was a good idea)
