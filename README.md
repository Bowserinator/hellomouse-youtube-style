# Hellomouse Youtube Styles

Around October 26th 2022 youtube released a new UI update, with lots of round buttons, broken features and etc...

(Like seriously why would you make the *channel name* and the *video title* the **SAME STYLE** in a thumbnail?!)

This extension undoes most of that (and has some "enhancements" of my own, you can look for them in the CSS and disable them if you don't like them)

### Installation:

1. Clone this repo (or download zip and extract)
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` and click "Load unpacked" (make sure developer mode is enabled)
3. Pick the folder that contains `manifest.json`
4. Profit

Firefox coming soon probably, someone open a PR
